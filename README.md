## About

My personal portfolio website forked from [Gatsby-theme-portfolio](https://github.com/smakosh/gatsby-theme-portfolio) by [Smakosh](https://github.com/smakosh)

## Tests

All tests are run using Cypress. You can either run them through the browser or with headless mode using the CLI. Please refer to the commands below, which can also be found in [package.json](./package.json):

```bash
e2e:cypress:browser
# Or
e2e:cypress:headless
```

## TODO
